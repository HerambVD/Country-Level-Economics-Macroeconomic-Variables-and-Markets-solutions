<p>Fifty years of planned development in India after getting independence from Britons have been aimed at the expansion of the economy through an increase in national product and employment. During the period 1960–2000, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of India grew positively and was higher than the employment growth. However, there was always a fluctuation in the growth of GDP. During this period, employment grew at a stable rate of about 2 percent. There were another disheartening development indicators in the late 1990s: employment growth started declining and reached the level of growth that India had in the early stages of planning. During these years, we also find a widening gap between the growth of GDP and employment. This means that in the Indian economy, without generating employment, India been able to produce more goods and services. This type of growth in India may be called jobless growth. However, in the past two decades, India has made substantial growth in the IT and Consulting field which has created a lot of jobs and to some extent has reduced the unemployment rate.</p>

<p>The informal sector consists of enterprises that have less than ten employees excluding the employer. Agriculture, Casual Laborers comprises the vast majority of the informal sector. The participation of women in the informal sector is  32% whereas in the formal sector it is only 17%. The formal sector comprises of Information Technology, Government organizations, etc. that requires highly educated or skilled workers. This less participation of women may imply that India is lagging behind to provide equal opportunities to women and training women adequately to sustain in the workforce.</p>

1. Suppose the price level in the US is 150 while the corresponding price level in the UK is 100. If the nominal exchange rate is e=2/3£/$, what is the real exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound (that is, how many baskets of British goods can be purchased with one corresponding basket of US goods)? 
 <br>
 <b>Answer: 1</b>
 <br><br>
2. During 1960-1990, the cost of a representative basket of goods produced in Japan steadily rose compared to a similar basket of goods produced in the US, when both baskets were evaluated in the same currency using the spot market exchange rate. Which one of the following factors contributed to that long-term real exchange rate appreciation?
 <br>
 <b>Answer: faster productivity of growth of tradable sector in Japan</b>
 <br><br>
3. During 1980-2008, the Chinese government followed a successful policy of increasing the productivity of the country's tradable sectors much faster than was the case in the rest of the world. If this policy had continued over the 2009-2016 period and if the productivity in China's non-tradable sector had grown at the same rate as that in the rest of the world, what would have been the impact on the real exchange rate of the Chinese currency, the yuan, vis-à-vis the US dollar?
 <br>
 <b>Answer: The real exchange rate of Yuan would have appreciated</b>
 <br><br>
4. Suppose the government of the United States introduces a permanent tax reduction without cutting expenditure over the next several years. The plan will go into effect next year. Assuming that tradables' prices in foreign currency are given, what will be the impact of this policy on the real exchange rate of the dollar vis-à-vis other currencies a few years from now?
<br>
 <b>Answer: The real exchange rate of US will appreciate</b>
 <br><br>

7. The prices of the inputs used for the production of airplanes in United States will be included in which of the two price indices?

8. The real exchange rate of an economy _________ when the relative price of non-tradables to tradables _________.
<br>
<b>Answer:  Rises; rises</b>

<b>Answer: False</b>
<br><br>
10. Suppose the productivity of the non-tradables sector in the Pakistan economy permanently reduces due to a natural calamity while the tradable sector remains unaffected.

<b>Answer: Appreciates</b>

1. The Fed increased the supply of US dollars at an average rate of 6 percent per year over the 1980-2005 period. Based on the theory of production capacity, if the Fed had instead increased the money supply at the rate of 7 percent per year during that period, given other policies: (Select all that apply.)

 <b>Answer: The economy would have enjoyed much higher level of outputs</b>
 <br><br>
2. At the time of its independence in 1947, India was a very poor country with a very small stock of physical capital. Between 1947 and 1980, the government of India believed that the best way to improve the standard of living in that country was to increase investment and create more jobs with the existing technology. Importing advanced technology and encouraging cost-saving innovations were seen as unnecessary because the government believed that such developments would reduce the need for labor and contribute to unemployment. Other things equal, the consequence of this policy for the long-run growth of the economy must have been:
 <br>
 <b>Answer: Accelerating economic growth</b>
 <br><br>

4. Venezuela’s economy was operating at production capacity until political turmoil reduced the production capacity of the country. To deal with the drop in GDP and to return the aggregate output to its pre-crisis level, the government of Venezuela has decided to increase its expenditure and stimulate demand, but it has found it hard to sell bonds and fund its expenditures. To solve this problem, the government has forced the central bank to print money and buy the bonds directly from the government. In this situation, the equilibrium income in Venezuela determined by the crossing of IS and LM curves:
<br>
 <b>Answer: Must above the production capasity</b>
 <br><br>
5. In the above question, what is likely to happen to the rate of inflation if the political turmoil continues and the government of Venezuela tries to keep the output level steady by continued fiscal and monetary expansion?

<b>Answer: The rate of inflation will accelerate</b>

6. In 1997, East Asian economies faced a major financial crisis, which reduced their incomes and their demands for US exports. Suppose the Fed believed that the negative impact of the crisis on the US economy would be sizable and would take a few years.

In that case, if the Fed wanted to stabilize the level of income and inflation in the US for the duration of the adverse demand shock, what should it have done?

<b>Answer: The Fed should have increased money supply</b>

You hire a consultant who tells you that everyone believes that: (1) the faster pace of East Asian countries this year is a one-time jump in income level and those economies will return to their 5 percent growth rate after this year; (2) the (risk-free) interest rates in East Asia will remain constant; and (3) the economic policies in the US will not change as a result of the temporary increase in Asia’s growth rate. If you believe these claims, you should conclude that by the end of this year, the developments in East Asia will tend to:

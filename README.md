<p>Fifty years of planned development in India after getting independence from Britons have been aimed at the expansion of the economy through an increase in national product and employment. During the period 1960â€“2000, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of India grew positively and was higher than the employment growth. However, there was always a fluctuation in the growth of GDP. During this period, employment grew at a stable rate of about 2 percent. There were another disheartening development indicators in the late 1990s: employment growth started declining and reached the level of growth that India had in the early stages of planning. During these years, we also find a widening gap between the growth of GDP and employment. This means that in the Indian economy, without generating employment, India been able to produce more goods and services. This type of growth in India may be called jobless growth. However, in the past two decades, India has made substantial growth in the IT and Consulting field which has created a lot of jobs and to some extent has reduced the unemployment rate.</p>

<p>The informal sector consists of enterprises that have less than ten employees excluding the employer. Agriculture, Casual Laborers comprises the vast majority of the informal sector. The participation of women in the informal sector is  32% whereas in the formal sector it is only 17%. The formal sector comprises of Information Technology, Government organizations, etc. that requires highly educated or skilled workers. This less participation of women may imply that India is lagging behind to provide equal opportunities to women and training women adequately to sustain in the workforce.</p>

2. In the short run, when prices are sticky and the goods market is in equilibrium, income rises as the interest rate declines because:
 <br>
 <b>Answer: All of the above</b>
 <br><br>
3. Suppose P, P*, Y, Y*, π, R, T, and G are exogenously given and the interest parity condition holds. Then aggregate “preferred” expenditure, D, rises when:
 <br>
 <b>Answer: The foreign aggregate price level rises</b>
 <br><br>
4. In general, as aggregate income of an economy rises:
<br>
 <b>Answer: Consumption demand rises by less than income rise</b>
 <br><br>
5. Which of the following factors does not shift the aggregate "preferred" expenditure (D) curve of an economy?
<br> 
<b>Answer: aggregate real income of the rest of the world</b>
<br><br>
6. Which of the following factors shifts the IS curve?
<br>
<b>Answer: Government Expenditure</b>
<br><br>
7. Latin America is a major export market for the US. If, as a result of a slump in commodity prices, the real incomes in Latin American countries decline, what would be the impact on the IS curve of the US economy?
<br> 
<b>Answer: The IS curve would shift left</b>
<br><br>
8. This year, country B held presidential elections and the government of the incumbent president temporarily increased public expenditure to win greater political support. Assuming that Ms, P, P*, Y*, and T were exogenously given, what kind of impact must this policy have had on the IS curve in country B?
<br>
<b>Answer:  The IS curve must have shifted right</b>
<br><br>
9. This year, country T held politically sensitive parliamentary elections and the government of the incumbent ruling party temporarily increased public expenditure to enhance its popularity. The government financed the additional expenditure by selling more bonds. Assuming that Ms, P, P*, Y*, and T were exogenously given, what kind of impact must this policy have had on the LM curve in country T?
<br>
<b>Answer: The LM curve should not have benn affected</b>
<br><br>
10. This year, country E held politically sensitive parliamentary elections and the government of the incumbent ruling party temporarily increased public expenditure to enhance its popularity. The government financed the additional expenditure by getting the country’s central bank to print money to finance the additional expenditure. Assuming that P, P*, Y*, and T were exogenously given, what kind of impact must this policy have had on the real income and interest rate in country E?
<br>
<b>Answer: Both real income and interest rate must have declined</b>

<p>Fifty years of planned development in India after getting independence from Britons have been aimed at the expansion of the economy through an increase in national product and employment. During the period 1960–2000, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of India grew positively and was higher than the employment growth. However, there was always a fluctuation in the growth of GDP. During this period, employment grew at a stable rate of about 2 percent. There were another disheartening development indicators in the late 1990s: employment growth started declining and reached the level of growth that India had in the early stages of planning. During these years, we also find a widening gap between the growth of GDP and employment. This means that in the Indian economy, without generating employment, India been able to produce more goods and services. This type of growth in India may be called jobless growth. However, in the past two decades, India has made substantial growth in the IT and Consulting field which has created a lot of jobs and to some extent has reduced the unemployment rate.</p>

<p>The informal sector consists of enterprises that have less than ten employees excluding the employer. Agriculture, Casual Laborers comprises the vast majority of the informal sector. The participation of women in the informal sector is  32% whereas in the formal sector it is only 17%. The formal sector comprises of Information Technology, Government organizations, etc. that requires highly educated or skilled workers. This less participation of women may imply that India is lagging behind to provide equal opportunities to women and training women adequately to sustain in the workforce.</p>

1. Suppose the price level in the US is 150 while the corresponding price level in the UK is 100. If the nominal exchange rate is e=2/3£/$, what is the real exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound (that is, how many baskets of British goods can be purchased with one corresponding basket of US goods)? 
 <br>
 <b>Answer: All of the above</b>
 <br><br>
2. During 1960-1990, the cost of a representative basket of goods produced in Japan steadily rose compared to a similar basket of goods produced in the US, when both baskets were evaluated in the same currency using the spot market exchange rate. Which one of the following factors contributed to that long-term real exchange rate appreciation?
 <br>
 <b>Answer: All of the above</b>
 <br><br>
3. During 1980-2008, the Chinese government followed a successful policy of increasing the productivity of the country's tradable sectors much faster than was the case in the rest of the world. If this policy had continued over the 2009-2016 period and if the productivity in China's non-tradable sector had grown at the same rate as that in the rest of the world, what would have been the impact on the real exchange rate of the Chinese currency, the yuan, vis-à-vis the US dollar?
 <br>
 <b>Answer: The foreign aggregate price level rises</b>
 <br><br>
4. Suppose the government of the United States introduces a permanent tax reduction without cutting expenditure over the next several years. The plan will go into effect next year. Assuming that tradables' prices in foreign currency are given, what will be the impact of this policy on the real exchange rate of the dollar vis-à-vis other currencies a few years from now?
<br>
 <b>Answer: Consumption demand rises by less than income rise</b>
 <br><br>
5. Which of the following reasons may account for the failure of the law of one price?
<br> 
<b>Answer: aggregate real income of the rest of the world</b>
<br><br>
6. The PPP hypothesis implies that the real exchange rate must be equal to which of the following? Select all that apply.
<br>
<b>Answer: Government Expenditure</b>
<br><br>
7. The prices of the inputs used for the production of airplanes in United States will be included in which of the two price indices?
<br> 
<b>Answer: The IS curve would shift left</b>
<br><br>
8. The real exchange rate of an economy _________ when the relative price of non-tradables to tradables _________.
<br>
<b>Answer:  The IS curve must have shifted right</b>
<br><br>
9. In the long run, the relative price of non-tradables to tradables is determined by the rate of growth of money supply.
<br>
<b>Answer: The LM curve should not have benn affected</b>
<br><br>
10. Suppose the productivity of the non-tradables sector in the Pakistan economy permanently reduces due to a natural calamity while the tradable sector remains unaffected. If all economic policies and other exogenous events in all countries remain unchanged, in the long-run, the real exchange rate of Pakistani Rupee vis-à-vis the US dollar:
<br>
<b>Answer: Both real income and interest rate must have declined</b>
<br><br>
